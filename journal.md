I think the new cell phone law was unessesary and more trouble then its worth. While I can admit it was a good thought, to get students more engaged and active in their learning, the exicution and reality did not agree. To begin, students who were not engaged before have no drive to be engaged in the first place, phones were just a way to stay entartained, not the reason behind their disengagement. In addition, if the student wants to be on their phone bad enough they will find a way to do so, that being though skipping, going to the restroom, or sneaking it in class where others cannot see. Lastly, the convinience of the phone for both students and teachers was taken away. All these instences prove that the phone ban was more trouble then it was worth and unessasary, it does not help students engage more, creates sneakyer students, and hinders those who do actively try in school and teachers who use technology for acedemic purposes.
